# freemarker-editor
This is a very simple freemarker editor for the Eclipse IDE. It does simple (but working) syntax highlighting. Further features may be supported at some time in the future. Feel free to contribute.

To install this editor simply extract the current release into your eclipse installation. You will probably also need to install Xtext from the Eclipse Marketplace.
